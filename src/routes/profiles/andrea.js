        description={"Yo, I'm Andrea, the intro specialist and motion designer who loves a challenge. I've been creating my own videos for over 10 years and eventually moved on to making motion graphics: I've created intros for big youtubers like Sky and Brofresco and made videos for LCS and OWL teams. Having grown my own youtube channel to over 100k subscribers, I learned exactly what viewers want to see, making me able to create a plan as great as its execution."}
