        description={"Yo I'm Jasmin Crowther, and go by the editing name Jhinxx. I have a degree in TV Production and specialised in editing during 4 years at university, but instead of working for a post-production house I decided to pursue editing for Youtube/Twitch/Gaming as it is more my passion. My clientele includes Dr Disrespect, several members of FaZe, Pokimane, LuxxBunny, Emiru, ProxyFox, Bjergsen, Aphromoo. I also like creating motion graphics and drawing anime, also working on putting out editing tutorials on YouTube!  I edit any game, anything and in anyway!"}
