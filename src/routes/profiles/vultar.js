        description={"I started video editing back in 2011 making Call of Duty montages on YouTube but quickly went from a hobby to a full time gig when I got involved editing for well established gaming channel (SoaRGaming). In 2015 I left to pursue a Video Editing & Post Production degree in London but still remained involved with the YouTube gaming scene editing twitch highlight videos for popular content creators! I am super passionate about making content that people love to watch and to have thousands of people see my work on a daily basis is more than I could ever ask for."}
