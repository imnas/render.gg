        description={"Hey! My name is Hayley Rumbold, also known as Haylox on the interweb. I’ve been video editing since my early teens and just recently turned it into a full time career. A big help in doing this was gaining a Film Production degree specialising in Video Editing and Visual Effects! My skillset revolves around Editing, 3D and Motion Graphics. With Render I have currently worked with some amazing clients such as Steel Series and Pack A Puncher. I’m always learning with the content I create and always trying to produce the best possible video which an audience will enjoy!"}
