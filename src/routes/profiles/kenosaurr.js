        description={"Hey ya'll! My name is Kenny and I go by the name Kenosaurr online. I started video editing on January 2017 primarily for fun as it was one of my main interests. My passion for video editing has led to me being able to create unique and visually appealing montages for everyone to see. I primarily specalize in editing video game montages ranging from any game including CS:GO, League of Legends, Destiny and Fortnite. Time management and meeting deadlines is one of my go to's as montages are generally completed within a week. I hope that you are interested in working with me!"}
