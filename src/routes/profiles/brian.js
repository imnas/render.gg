These edits gave me loads of experience with After Effects, motion designing and even some 3D. Through that I had the opportunity to work for Sneaky, Jensen, Valkrin and many more. I always try to go the extra step while still finishing a video in time. Great editing usually goes unnoticed and that is something I definitely strive for."}
