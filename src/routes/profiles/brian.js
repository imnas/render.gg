        description={"Hello there! My name is Brian. also known as Brian./PreBot. I am a completely self taught editor. I started making short clip edits, which gave me loads of experience with After Effects, motion designing and 3d. Through that I had the opportunity to work for Sneaky, Jensen, Valkrin and many more. I always try to give extra on top of what is expected. While still finishing a video in time. Great editing usually goes unnoticed. That is something I definitely try to go for."}
