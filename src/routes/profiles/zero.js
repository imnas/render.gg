        description={"Hey there! My name's JoÃ£o, also know as Zero Infinity on Youtube. I have been editing foraround 4 years now, with the mindset of combining two of my biggest passions together, video editing and games. After years of developing my skills, I ended up realizing I could use my knowledge to create a freelancing career for myself and started producing content for severalpersonalities and organizations, such as Locodoco and FoxdropLoL and even had the fortune to participate in the Youtube Creators Lab 2.0, hosted by Riot Games. I greatly enjoy the aspects of Motion Graphics and 3D Animations and hope to able to inspire others, to follow their passions with my work."}
