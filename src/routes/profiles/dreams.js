I started by editing Call of Duty montages in 2014 for organizations like FaZe Clan, Red Reserve, and Obey Alliance. Since i have rerouted my skills into motion design and have worked with big names like TSM Myth and FaZe Cizzorz. Whether it is an animation to brand your name or footage that needs to be edited, I am more than happy to get to it!"}
