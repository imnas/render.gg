        description={"Hi! My name is Stephen Dressler, but I go by Stevo Tevo online. I'm a self-taught video editor, dabbling in it ever since I was 12. But in late 2017, I decided to pursue it as a career. I have worked with Kaypea, Nightblue3, and more recently Pokimane. I think my favorite thing about being a video editor is having the ability to turn simple gameplay from someone's Twitch stream into a compelling story for the audience. My editing adventures have only just begun and I can't wait to see what the future holds!"}
