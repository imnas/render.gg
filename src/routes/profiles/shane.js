        description={"Hey everyone, my name is Cloud I've been editing since I was around 14 so around 6/7 years now and 2 years ago I decided I wanted to make it work full time so I made my dream a reality. I'm currently working for Lourlo and Smoothie and I'm always looking to improve on editing, sometimes I could spend weeks on a project that'd make little to no money but having a good finished product is worth it. I hope you enjoy my vids!"}
