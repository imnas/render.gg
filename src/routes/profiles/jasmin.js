        description={"Yo, I'm Jasmin, my editing name is Jhinxx. After graduating with a degree in TV Production specialising in editing and sound, I decided that i'd like to mix my love of gaming and editing and pursue becoming a YT highlight editor. I also enjoy creating motion graphics and photo manipulation, but i'd also like to go back to my roots of editing dramas and documentaries. I mainly work with Emiru, I have also done work for Pokimane, ProxyFox and LuxxBunny. I like to give female streamers an editor they can relate to."}
