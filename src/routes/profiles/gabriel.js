        description={"Hello, my name is Gabriel Mateo, I also go by '4our'. Formerly Krappy Patty. I started my career with my own YouTube channel, I then had the opportunity to work for Tobias Fate as a video editor. Following this, I decided to pursue my own freelancing career producing videos for both Shiphtur and Froggen. My skillset is specialized in video editing, motion graphics and 3d animation. Using these skills and various others techniques I've learned, I am able to make the best videos possible for my clients."}
