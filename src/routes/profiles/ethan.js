        description={"Hey, I'm Ethan del Rosario! I'm actually fairly new in the editing scene, having only started back in June 2016 after graduating from high school. After a few months of hard work and practice, I was able to take it to the next level and edit professionally! My first ever job was at Garena of the same year, and it only got better from there! I've since then been able to work for clients like Riot Games, Dyrus, Bjergsen, and a lot more! I've fallen in love with editing and content creation in general, there are just so many things you can do and so many ways you can tackle a project! I've been able express myself in ways I never would've imagined were possible, and I take pride in every single piece I've accomplishedâ€” they are in essence, an extension of myself. I do, after all, pour my heart and soul into what I do."}
