        description={"Hi! My name's Robert, or also known as 'Skroll'. I'm a self taught graphic designer specializing in social media, YouTube and Twitch design. I started a few years ago out of curiosity and it quickly became a passion I'm still following today. I've worked with plenty of youtubers and streamers these past years, including Scarra, Gross Gore, Tarzaned and many more. Currently looking to pursue a Graphic Design school for a proper degree."}
