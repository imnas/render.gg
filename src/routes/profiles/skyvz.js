        description={"My name is Skyvz, but other people know me as Caleb. I'm a 20 year old Video Editor who lives in the United States. I'm currently majoring in film at college, but I originally started out editing video games when I was 16. After a few years of practicing and learning new tricks, I achieved my goal of making video editing into a career. I have done work in the past for the League of Legends YouTubers Protatomonster and Pink Ward. I've also worked with Buzz and XFactor Gaming on some smaller projects. In my spare time, I also enjoy making short clip edits of various games ranging from League of Legends all the way to Call of Duty for my own YouTube channel. I'm proud to be a part of the Render team, and it makes me happy to know that I get to work alongside such talented individuals."}
