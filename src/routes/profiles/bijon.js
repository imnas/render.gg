        description={"Ayo my name is Bijon Magee, otherwise known as Zino. I'm a 17 year old Editor, Digital Artist, and fairly decent Graphics Designer from Canada, currently living in the USA. I started editing as a job when I was 15, working first with a League of Legends YouTuber by the name of Phy. Since then I've continued my work with him and have also worked with other YouTubers/Streamers in the League of Legends community such as his brother Foxdrop, Fox Family Gaming (Rick & Kyle Fox), and most recently Aphromoo. Glad to be a part of the Render team, and I've made some good friends with the others here. I look forward to working with them more in the future!"}
